## Developing Wyldcard applications on your Devkit ##

The Wyldcard Devkit contains a raspberry pi zero 2, on which you can run your entire development environment. This makes is easier to iterate on game design, no need to write then then push it to the device, you can change code and immediately run it and see how it behaves.

Of course, you can do anything you like with the Raspberry Pi, but I believe this is a nice setup.

TODO
- Connect first time
- wifi
- VS Code remote (examples dir)
- add plugins (actually maybe not, only needed by me for rust)
- running it (node.js)

make your own project
- create a new directory, git setup, maybe i should have one ready to go already
