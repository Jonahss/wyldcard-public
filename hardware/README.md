The important bits of the Wyldcard hardware are the Wyldcards themselves and the interface between cards and the plinth they rest on.
The interface diagram shows where to put the magnets which hold the cards and plinth together, and the arrangement of electrical contacts.

In this folder, find a diagram of the physical layout for the interface, and a circuit diagram used for driving the Good Display GDEW029T5D e-paper display.
